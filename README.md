# skratch

Create a scratch file in a specific place.

### Why

I often make small files that I want saved in git but don't warrent a whole repo. I would not organize this well enough without a tool to do it.

### Usage

Make an empty Python file

```
sk .py
```

Make an empty file

```
sk
```

### Install

```sh
make install
```
